Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data

This project explores various deep learning models for sentiment analysis of Twitter data. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to determine the sentiment expressed in text data, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to compare the performance of different deep learning architectures for sentiment analysis of Twitter data. The project focuses on three main approaches:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Model: This model utilizes LSTM cells, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture sequential dependencies in the Twitter text data.

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) Model: Similar to the LSTM model, this approach employs GRU cells, which are a variant of RNNs, to learn the sentiment patterns present in the Twitter data.

Transfer Learning: This approach leverages pre-trained language models, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), to extract features from the Twitter text data and perform sentiment analysis.

Key Features:

The project provides a comprehensive comparison of the performance, accuracy, and computational efficiency of the LSTM, GRU, and transfer learning models for sentiment analysis.
It includes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, text vectorization, and padding to prepare the Twitter data for input into the deep learning models.
Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the performance of each model.
The project offers flexibility for users to experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and training strategies to optimize the sentiment analysis task.
Dataset:
The project utilizes a publicly available Twitter dataset containing tweets labeled with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral or irrelevant). The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets for model training and evaluation.

Usage:
Users can clone the repository and follow the provided instructions to train and evaluate the LSTM, GRU, and transfer learning models on the Twitter sentiment analysis task. Additionally, pre-trained model weights and evaluation results are provided for reference.

Dependencies:
The project requires the following dependencies:

TensorFlow (for deep learning model implementation)
Hugging Face Transformers (for transfer learning models)
NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn (for data preprocessing and evaluation)
Matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)
